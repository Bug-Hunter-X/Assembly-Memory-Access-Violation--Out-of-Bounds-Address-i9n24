mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10`.  The bug arises when the resulting address is outside the bounds of allocated memory. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.  The problem isn't immediately obvious because the calculation itself is syntactically correct; the error lies in the underlying data, particularly the values of `ebx`, `ecx`, and the size of the allocated memory region.
